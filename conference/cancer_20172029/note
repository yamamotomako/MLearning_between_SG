Scripts for cancer conference 20170929.
Two machine learning methods are applied for somatic and germline cancer genome.
These two scripts are on the way of completion and there are many future works.
In the future works (as of 20171001),
    1. Normalization - Scales should be set to be the same
    2. Cross validation - Test data should be undergone the cross validation due to the weakness of decision tree algorithms.
    3. Evalutation - As the test data is randomly sampled, the learning and its result should be undergone for many times and the average among the distribution should be calculated.
    4. Other algorithms - Such as svm and neural networks will improve the mismatch ratio of prediction.
    5.
